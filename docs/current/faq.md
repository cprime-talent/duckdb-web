## How is DuckDB related to MonetDB or MonetDBLite?
DuckDB is a new from-scratch development. There is no connection to MonetDB or MonetDBLite from an architectural perspective. We have borrowed ca. 200 lines of code related to date math however. We are indepted to multiple software projects and scientific publications, a list [is available](https://github.com/cwida/duckdb#standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants).
